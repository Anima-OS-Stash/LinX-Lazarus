LinX
========

This is the old LinX — a Windows GUI for Intel Linpack.
You probably don't want to see the code — it is as ugly as it ever gets. It's also written in Delphi.

N. B. in case you do go forth and see the code: All of this was written by a student me. My coding habits have somewhat (drastically) improved since that time.

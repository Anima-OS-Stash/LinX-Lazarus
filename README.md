LinX - Lazarus
==============

This is a fork of LinX to make it compilable with Lazarus, the Free Delphi 
compatible cross-platform IDE.

The project is ready-to-use: open LinX.lpi in Lazarus and build. (but 
Linpack must be installed in the proper directory, 64-bit/ or 32-bit/)

The main goal of this project is to make a real 64 bits binary of LinX. 
This version currently lacks a few (minor to me) things:

 - screenshots
 - window flashing
 - Aero/GlassFrame look

What is LinX ?
==============

This is the old LinX — a Windows GUI for Intel Linpack.
You probably don't want to see the code — it is as ugly as it ever gets. It's also written in Delphi.

N. B. in case you do go forth and see the code: All of this was written by a student me. My coding habits have somewhat (drastically) improved since that time.

- improved GUI look when scaling is enabled
- minor enhancements


LinX 0.5.8

- now it is not necessary to run a test for current settings to be saved

LinX 0.5.6

- interface fixes and enhancements, Linpack mode and number of threads are now displayed in statusbar
- CPU name is noe displayed in statusbar
- Linpack mode is now mentioned in text log too


LinX 0.5.5

- improved threading control. 2 Linpack processes are created no more to load all "cores" on HT processors
- added tray icon option. When enabled, LinX will be minimized to tray
- small interface fixes


LinX 0.5.4:

- HyperThreading support added
- thread control added. You can now set the number of threads Linpack will create and thus control the number of physical cores that will be stressed. This setting is located in the Settings window (who'd have thought? )
- Settings window with all existing and a couple of new settings added. No need to edit the ini-file manually now
- main menu redesigned
- lots of minor bugs found and fixed
- performance optimized a little bit more
- graphs have now customizable top and bottom limits
- changed the icon a bit


LinX 0.5.3:

- the temporary log file is no more created during testing, performance increased a little
- the v10.1 Linpack executables are now AMD compatible too
- log interface redesigned
- All mem ("All") button added. When in pressed state LinX will always use the current maximum available memory
- localization support via the "local.lng" file added


LinX 0.5.2:

- Linpack executables updated to version 10.1 (for Intel CPUs only; for AMD users there's still Linpack 10.0 with no CPU restrictions, just rename and replace the linpack_xeon32.exe_amd and linpack_xeon64.exe_amd)
- added Speedfan support. LinX can now import such data as CPU temperature, vcore, fan speed and +12V voltage from Speedfan. Fill in the values in the Speedfan.ini file in LinX' folder for this to work (see readme for more details)
- some interface enhancements/fixes
- consumed memory calculation is slightly improved
- LinX now uses ini-files (LinX.ini and Speedfan.ini) to store its settings in. Those who like tweaking things may now override default values for the amount of memory to leave for OS in Max mem mode and maximum Problem size for Linpack32
- the Leading Dimensions value is now adjusted for maximum performance instead of being equal to Problem Size value. This can be disabled via the UseOptimizedLeadingDimensions=0 key in the LinX.ini


LinX 0.5.1:

- LinX can now create, display and save as PNG graphs for CPU temp, CPU fan speed, vcore and +12V voltage based on Everest data. Graphs are shown in separate windows, can be resized and made semi-transparent
- the green status field now flashes in all time modes (elapsed, remaining & finish time)
- you can now make screenshot of LinX's window by pressing the F5 key. The screenshot will be saved as LinX.png in program's folder. Pressing F5 in graph windows will save the corresponding graph (not the whole window) as PNG image


LinX 0.5.0

- added Everest support. LinX can now display CPU temperature from Everest. The displayed temperature is the temperature of the hottest core; if a CPU doesn't have core sensors then a temperature from an external sensor is displayed. For this to work you'll need to have Everest running in background with "Enable shared memory" option checked (in Everest "File -> Preferences -> External Applications"; you might also want to set update frequency to 1 sec for external applications and adjust Tjmax value)
- added an option to stop testing if CPU temp exceeds the desired temp (see above)
- LinX now correctly reads values from damaged lininput file
- and saves most of its settings on exit


LinX 0.4.9

- LinX' window is now vertically resizeable for better log visibility
- fixed a program error that occured when an error was detected on last run
- "Always on top" mode added (double click window's caption to toggle)
- LinX now saves window size on exit
- when "Enable sounds" checkbox is checked sound will be played on successfull completion of all tests too
- interface fixes/improvements


LinX 0.4.8

- once again rewritten that "polling" algorithm. LinX' window can now be safely moved during testing


LinX 0.4.7

- Linpack "polling" algorithm rewritten, resulting in noticeable performance increase. Only one temporary file is used during testing now
- maximum Problem Size for 32-bit Linpack corrected
- added Residual (norm) power check (to detect some errors after 1st pass)
- samll interface fixes


LinX 0.4.6

- thanks to Right again 64-bit Linpack now works with AMD processors
- improved algorithm for retrieving total/available memory. Now LinX correctly determines free memory on 32-bit OSes with more than 2 GB of RAM and on 64-bit OSes with more than 4 GB of RAM
- added ~2 GB maximum memory limit for 32-bit Linpack (due to Linpack's inner restriction)
